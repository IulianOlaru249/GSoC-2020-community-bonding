    The pos will be 200: 100 bytes from the Makefile reported to 
the starting position, and another 100 reporting to the prev 100 
byes from the same file.

    fd2 should be closed in order to make sure no file descriptor
points to the Makefile. Even if fd1 closes, fd2 will still point to
the Makefile.

    TO REMEMBER: The cursor will keep its position in the file even 
if the filed is refered by another file descriptor.
