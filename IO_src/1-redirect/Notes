    Used watch -d lsof -p $(pidof redirect) to check how redirect works.

    Stderr is redirected to a new file descriptor, so everything printed to stderr 
is printed to that file: dup2(fd2, STDERR_FILENO).

    If the parameters were in diffrent order, it would have ment that fd2 si 
redirected to stderr, so wverything written to fd2 would have been refirected to
stderr: dup2(STDERR_FILENO, fd2).

************************************************************************************
    dup(fd1) can be interpreted as: associate the first available file 
descriptor to the file refered by fd1.

    dup2(fd1, fd2) can be interpreted as: associate file descriptor fd2 to 
file refered by file descriptor fd1.
